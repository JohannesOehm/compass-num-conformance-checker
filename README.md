The NUM COMPASS conformance checker provides an endpoint to validate example resources of the [German Corona Consensus Dataset](https://simplifier.net/guide/GermanCoronaConsensusDataSet-ImplementationGuide/Home) (GECCO). The app is part of the [COMPASS](https://num-compass.science/en/compass/profile/) (Coordination on mobile pandemic apps best practice and solution sharing) project, which aims to improve how apps are used to cope with pandemics.

It offers both validation of single resources, and a full conformance check that validates a set of test data generated by a NUM COMPASS app.

For full technical documentation, see the [_docs/_](./docs/README.md) folder.
